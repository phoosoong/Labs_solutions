## Task 1. Create an API key
Since you use curl to send a request to the Speech-to-Text API, you need to generate an API key to pass in your request URL.

To create an API key, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon) click APIs & services > Credentials.

Click Create credentials and select API key.

Copy and record the key you just generated to use later in this lab.
